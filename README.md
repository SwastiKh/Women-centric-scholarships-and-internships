# Scholarships and Internship Opportunities for Women-in-Tech in India

### This is a non-exhaustive list of opportunities available to Women students. These positions are mostly focussed towards Women-in-Tech in India.

This list is an attempt to bring all opportunities together at one place. It is a humble request to the users to contribute any new opportunity you discover and update the old ones. Without updation, the web-links will break, and the list will become futile! I'll make sure that any such modification in the `README.md` raised as an issue or submitted as a pull request be timely reviewed and added.
